- use px for image sizing
- use rem for font sizing
- use em for padding and margins
- use min-height, max-width for containers with px

1. Transforming text

text-transform: capitalize; - will capitalize every first letter of the word.
text-transform: lowercase;
text-transform: uppercase;

2. Viewport Units
- vh 
- 1vh = 1% of the viewport height
- use min-height: 100vh;

-vw
- you can use vw for font-size to make it fluid when resizing the screen!

3. background

-background-image: url("");
-background-size: cover/contain;
-background-position: center;
-background: #9480e4 url("images/background-img.jpg");
-You can use a color as well as a fall back background just incase the image does not load.

4. Forms
- letter-spacing: 
- Pseudo class :focus: border, background-color
- they do not inherint font-family so use:
- font-family: inherit;

5. Modifier Classes
- Second class that you declare to an element to add specific designs other than the base design that the first class does.
- This makes your CSS more reusable and flexible. 

<button class="btn btn-primary">

6. Reordering flex items

.tube{
      order: -1;
}

The order value is 0 by default. So if you want to move it to left, you use negative numbers. To the right, would be positive.

7. max-width
- apply max-width to containers to prevent stretching of items.

8. CSS box-sizing

box-sizing: border-box;

- This property squeezes all the borders and the paddings into the total set size of the element. 
- apply this to the universal selector: * 
- use *, *::before, *::after if your website is using pseudo-elements
